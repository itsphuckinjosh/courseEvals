"Josh is a fantastic teacher. He offers great constructive criticism and works with each of us to answer any questions or concerns we may have. It is clear as day that he knows what he is talking about because he offers great resources, insights, is knowledgeable in design history and is on top of the latest design trends. Super relatable and understanding. Always encouraged us to experiment and gave us new tools to work with depending on what we were trying to do. The more effort you put in his class, the more you will gain from the class. He showed us many designers, even brought in several typography/design books, and gave us lots of typography related readings to help teach us and inspire us. I came into this class unsure on whether I would even like typography or even knowing what it really is and now I've grown quite fond of it. His genuine excitement for teaching and sharing typography and design is really what motivated me to challenge myself and helped me appreciate typography so much. He also changed the way he taught certain things in class to better suit the class's needs which is just awesome because it just creates a better learning environment. I hope to have him in a future class because it was rad getting to learn from him.",Northeastern Illinois University,Type 1,F21
"I found this class to be very intriguing Josh was always helpful and understanding. He was a bit of a hard grader, but always gave opportunities to fix anything so it evened out.",Northeastern Illinois University,Type 1,F21
"Josh was fantastic; engaging and fun. To be honest, there wasn't a moment of dullness on the course. I would definitely take another course with him as the professor even if the course wasn't required.",Northeastern Illinois University,Type 1,F21
"Type 1 was easily one of my favorite classes this semester. I think Josh is a great instructor that pushes his students to take it to the next level while remaining encouraging, helpful and very patient. I learned so much through this course and had lots of fun doing the material. I think the structure of the class ( the workshops in the beginning) up to the final project (everything we learned condensed into one book final) is perfect. I felt confident enough to explore design by the time we had our final project. One critique would be on the pacing of the class since the final seemed a tad bit rushed so ideally, I would've liked slightly more time but overall, it was great. I came in with little to no knowledge of this course and left with so much consideration, appreciation and knowledge of design. Thank you Josh for helping me feel confident about choosing design (I think I really really really like it). It was a pleasure being your student!",Northeastern Illinois University,Type 1,F21
"This course was such an exciting experience! I did learn quite a lot from it! However, a couple of students were short on the essay word count during the book project and didn't have enough to fill their section. If the first draft had been returned sooner, with comments, they would have been able to work on those issues before they started the book project. Also, the Book Project should get that extra time towards the end. The project will become this tangible and permanent thing that everyone else will get to see, so students should get that time to push and polish their work. Other than that, I had a good experience! I loved the passion and enthusiasm you brought to each class!",Northeastern Illinois University,Type 1,F21
"Josh is an excellent teacher, incredibly understanding, and goes at great lengths to make sure his students succeed. One of the best teachers I've had thus far.",The University of Illinois Chicago,Color Theory,F21
I thought that the comments Josh made on my work were very helpful and I liked that there was time in class to work on our projects.,The University of Illinois Chicago,Color Theory,F21

"Friendly environment, very interactive instructor. Amazing job!",The University of Illinois Chicago,Color Theory,F21
"I loved having Josh as a teacher, he was the best teacher I had this semester. I wish I could have him all my time at this school. I loved going to his class.",The University of Illinois Chicago,Color Theory,F21
"Josh is a really great instructor, very clear, makes you want to be in class.",The University of Illinois Chicago,Color Theory,F21
Josh went into great detail and was always willing to help out any student or extend deadlines based on the class's schedule.,The University of Illinois Chicago,Color Theory,F21
Great teacher and environment!,The University of Illinois Chicago,Color Theory,F21
The overall environment in this class was great we were all very vocal when we were confused and when we needed help everyone asked.,The University of Illinois Chicago,Color Theory,F21
"Very effective lectures, great idea of recording every one.",The University of Illinois Chicago,Color Theory,F21
"I've enjoyed this class despite the fact that I felt it lacked in a few areas we discussed about, but overall, you are on the right track on how you want to teach the class and I hope that you are able to continue teaching here.",Columbia College,Fundamentals of Visual Design,F21
"I enjoyed the opportunity to take this class with Josh! Any of my complaints about the class were due to the class's overall setup that was outside of his control. It was one of my favorite classes this semester, but the workload was daunting many weeks, especially while juggling other classes. I think the class overall could be improved by student feedback, but Josh's teaching was great!",Columbia College,Fundamentals of Visual Design,F21
"Honestly, I'm surprised Mr. Cook is an adjunct professor because it seems to me that he would really flourish in this environment and has his own ideas about how to improve curriculum here at Columbia.",Columbia College,Fundamentals of Visual Design,F21
"I got a decent amount of experience from this course, and while I'm still honing my art skills, it did at least expand my understanding of Photoshop to make it a little less daunting.",Loyola University Chicago,Pixel,S22
"I think the class was paced well. I never felt too stressed or overwhelmed with the course work. It is very helpful to have the recorded demos online so that we can go back and refer to them while working. However, I would like to see specific rubrics and a more clear grading breakdown. We receive plenty of comments, but I would like to see how the 5 point scale we are graded on translates to letter grades.",Loyola University Chicago,Pixel,S22
"Taking a 9 am art class in a warm, dark classroom was not the play. Class time tended to be dull because everyone (including myself) was being lulled back asleep by the time and room conditions.",Loyola University Chicago,Pixel,S22
Sometimes the demos were so confusing,Loyola University Chicago,Pixel,S22
Josh is a great professor. He is always willing to provide feedback and will do specific demos even if just one student has a question. During the critiques he gives very helpful feedback and manages to be constructive while never mean. I appreciate his laidback demeanor. He also has the most interesting and obscure music taste I have ever heard.,Loyola University Chicago,Pixel,S22
"Professor Cook was great and I wish I had the energy to have had interacted with him more to try to improve my projects. One thing I wish he did was put more links and/or announcements on the class Sakai page, because scrolling through a long email chain to find the info I needed became very annoying the further we got into the semester.",Loyola University Chicago,Pixel,S22
"I think the class went well. It was interesting to learn different kinds of programs to create animation. Although I had fun doing the stop motion countdown, I think I would have preferred to get into After Effects earlier. Because it's such a complex program I would have liked to dedicate the majority of the class to it. I have made stop motion videos before and they are not very complicated. I also think that for some of projects we have too much time at the beginning and not enough time to actually complete the assignment. I don't need a week to complete a storyboard, but I could use that time to actually complete the final project.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F22
"As a teacher new to Loyola, I believe that Professor Cook is a great fit for the art program as he is a fan favorite among the students",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F22
Josh is very knowledgable about design and is a great professor. I enjoy his classes and his demos.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F22
"I thought it was a great course. I think the first few assignments where students were required to turn in ten deliverables was a lot, but other than that it was a great class.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
"Though the beginning of the semester does seem to drag on, once you get to the Type Series projects, I think you start to fully grasp a sense of the artistic principles in graphic design. Working from the ground up is a great way to establish the basics so you don't dive in too deep all at once! Critiques are a little difficult sometimes because we're still learning and there are only so many ways critique text and image placement, and I think I got the most helpful advice from Josh himself, anyway.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
"I think the course as it stands is far too strict. The projects often seem like busy work, or are incredibly tedious and time consuming. They do not feel like they are fostering a love for graphic design or any sort of creative thought around it.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
"The readings assigned for the class were really good and definitely made me think more critically about modernism, design, and mainstream design work.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
"Prof. Cook was an amazing teacher. He clearly explains things, provides great feedback, and is super helpful and accommodating when it comes to a lab class and is always willing to work with you.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
I really liked josh! It was clear he really cared about his students and wanted us to succeed.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
"I really liked Josh! I think he always offers helpful suggestions and insight when critiquing our projects. I appreciated the feedback I received on all of my projects, especially as someone who has limited experience with digital design. His tangents when giving critiques are always interesting to listen to, even if they aren't always totally related, but you can tell he is interested in the subjects and in seeing us grow and experiment as artists and designers. A fun guy and I'm excited to learn more from him in the coming semesters.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
One of the best instructors I've had in a long time. The material had a strong potential to be overwhelming but he guided us through it and offered insights on historical influences and ways to be most effective in the fields of typography and graphic design.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
The response time for messages on Discord and emails was slow or often did not happen at all.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
"Josh often reads from a script when lecturing in class, which makes explanations of often already complicated concepts even more difficult to understand. He spends a great deal of time lecturing, with much less time discussing projects, techniques of graphic design, or interacting with the students.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F22
"Really cool class. I liked most of the projects we did. Did not like how they overlapped, but I know Josh already took note of that for the future.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F22
I think this class has been great. I really enjoyed all of the projects we have done and found them interesting.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F22
Professor Cook made the course interesting and allowed us to get creative.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F22
Great instructor! He knows so much about the programs we use and is very helpful when we have questions. Loved the class and I learned a lot.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F22
"Josh is great. I really appreciate the individual attention he gives us during desk critiques. He always has suggestions to take our work further. He provides great feedback and I appreciate that he encourages us to be creative and will work with us to execute our ideas. His laid- back attitude creates a stress free environment, but I can expect his honest and constructive feedback on assignments. I'm so glad he's teaching more courses at Loyola.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F22
Josh is really cool. He is very knowledgeable and passionate about graphic design.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F22
I really liked that Josh gave us opportunities to give feedback on projects and the course design throughout the semester. Demos could be more dialed in so it's easier to find the information students are looking for.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F22
You will leave this class knowing more about the graphic design history . He also pushes you to think conceptually and creative. He demonstrated a lot of knowledge in the matter and supported us with any crazy idea we'd come to get assistance on.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F22
I will never take this professor again.,Loyola University Chicago,Digital Media Design,F22
"Good course, organized well. Great demos.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
I liked that Professor Cook recorded his demos so that I could go back and watch them when I was working on my project on my own. That was very helpful.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
"I really liked the projects and design of the class. It wasn't what I was expecting as I thought we would have a lot more creative freedom and would be utilizing multiple softwares. I think you have to go into this class knowing all of that and if you don't then you will be really disappointed. The projects, especially in the beginning felt very boring and tedious and it wasn't clear the purpose behind them.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
"The department is very lucky to have this professor. Every lecture and assignment is organized perfectly, and it's all very reasonable. I have learned a ton thanks to him, and I'm happy to be taking him again next semester.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
This class would have been significantly more enjoyable and easier if the Digital Media class was a pre-req. I felt like my lack of experience with Adobe software made it hard to make the designs that I wanted/envisioned in my head.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
"Great teacher, perfect for the class.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
Very understanding with my many questions about how to use Adobe software.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
I really appreciated Josh's passion for the subject of typography and book design. I think seeing his passion for the subject made me want to be more interested in it and engage with what was happening in the class. I also really appreciated his push to get us to think outside the box and in crazy standards. It made my brain push hard to think outside the box which has always been difficult for me. One thing that I struggled with this semester was how fast Josh went when teaching. I don't think he entirely realized majority of the class had little to no experience with the InDesign software. Josh tended to move through demos very fast in the beginning of the year and I would get really lost with what tools in the software I could be using. As we ended the semester I could do better at keeping up but I think that was more due to my work on understanding the software outside of class.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
Professor Cook is a wonderful instructor who is passionate and eager to provide constructive feedback and encourage critical thinking about design.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
"I enrolled in this class as a minor requirement for visual communication, but I have since changed by minor to be a minor in studio art.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S23
"I think there could be a little more organization, but besides that it was a good class!",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S23
"I like the collaboration aspect of the class. Discussions and critiques went a little long, but I think that was due more to the class rather than the structure of it.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S23
"I thought that this class was super well organized and the projects were thoroughly thought out. This is one of the best classes that I've taken at Loyola. There was lots of room for interacting with both classmates and the professor, which really helped to boost the strength of the projects we made. 10/10.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S23
"The first project felt like it lasted a tad too long, I enjoyed the readings but perhaps the discussions could be shorted to less than the entirety of the two hour class. By the end, it was difficult to pay attention.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S23
The course was a lot of fun and it really helped me feel more confident in my work.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S23
"I think that Josh is an excellent professor. He has a good habit of checking in with students both on a wide scale and individually, which is impressive especially for a larger sized class. He also made the class environment an atmosphere that made me feel confident in sharing my thoughts and asking questions. Throughout the course of the class, I never felt like I was not getting enough support to complete a project. Josh is a great professor, I don't think I could say enough good things about him.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S23
He's a great guy. Always tells you how to refine your ideas and think more outside the box. Really glad to have had him as a professor for the school year.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S23
The Professor really made us feel as though he cared about the well being of the students.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S23
"I think that this class was super well organized and taught in a way that did not feel overwhelming. I was a little nervous prior to starting the class because I had zero experience with motion design, but the way that the projects were set up really allowed to utilize After Effects with success. I also really enjoyed experimenting with different mediums within motion design, not just digitally. I really loved this class and thought it was super fun and interesting.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S23
"Josh was a fantastic instructor. He was very diligent about providing us with both in person and video lectures throughout the course. He was very attentive to us and was always asking us what he can do to improve the course, which is very important from the standpoint of a student. I have no complaints about Josh, definitely the better of professors that I've had at Loyola.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S23
"He did a great job of encouraging creativity in all the students and providing good feedback, which I appreciated. I do wish that the demos that he did were clear both in title and content because they were a bit hard to follow",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S23
Great teacher! I am graduating but if I were staying I would keep taking Josh's classes.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S23
Josh is one of the few professors I have had that really teaches the class with the intention to help students learn at their own pace and not try to overwhelm students with software and programs that they have never used before. He allows us a lot of creative freedom and is very helpful.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S23
"Josh is great. I am really glad that I have had him as a professor for many courses. I really value his feedback on my work. He is incredibly smart. I am always blown away that he is able to come up with good ideas so quickly, that really benefit my projects. I appreciate his laid back demeanor. I think he is the right level of relaxed while still keeping the course structured.",Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S23
Great job! Some FNAR teachers have been not as helpful with questions about class and even the real world and you were so helpful. Thanks for always being open to chatting!,Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S23
"I didn't even have to read any of the questions because this is one of the most fun and challenging classes I have ever had to take. Josh is great with getting design students ready for the real world. Not all designers just live on the Adobe Suite, and Josh knows this. He allows us to learn softwares that will help us stand out in the future while allowing us lots of creative freedom",Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S23
"This class challenged me in the perfect way. All the assignments were fun and interesting. I feel like it is difficult to come up with art assignments that have enough guidelines where you don't feel overwhelmed by options, but open enough where you can still be creative with it. Josh does a great job of balancing all of his assignments.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F23
"I really appreciated how the course was organized on OneDrive, I think it made the most sense to use for this course.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F23
"I thought that VisCom 1 was a very instructive course! It helped me improve my skills in design and taught me a lot of interesting concepts and ideas in the field of
typography.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F23
"Josh Cook is easily one of the best professors at Loyola. Not only does he listen to his students and also want to learn from us, but he is also extremely understanding. No matter what your level of experience in graphic design is, he makes this course equally do-able and challenging. Would highly recommend Josh to anyone taking VIS COM 1!",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F23
Josh is a fantastic professor. His classes are very dynamic and engaging. He asks for feedback all throughout the course so that he can adapt and mold assignments better in the future. It really shows how he actually cares about student opinions and thoughts. I loved being in his classes.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F23
Josh was extremely helpful throughout the entire semester. He's very understanding and wants us to learn tangible design skills. I genuinely enjoyed having him as a professor and he has shaped my experience in FNAR classes at Loyola.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F23
I appreciated his attitude a lot and it helped me engage with the material. He was a great resource when navigating adobe suite for the first time and I liked that we worked on multiple programs.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F23
"He's a nice guy, but he's very scattered and all over the place. The assignments were hard at times to figure out what he wanted from us and weren't always clear on instructions. Additionally, there were some discrepancies within the instructions. However, he was easygoing and never really penalized you if you did something that didn't exactly follow the guidelines.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F23
This course was one of the most challenging design courses I've ever taken. It was also probably the most fulfilling course to take as a designer. It introduced me to graphic design history and literature. I was pushed as a creative to discover the root of my inspiration. It exceeded my expectations for the overall end result of a class.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F23
Good!,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F23
"I enjoyed how the course made us engage with the readings and think about the content more deeply it was a nice change from just the usual read, respond, and onto the next mindset.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F23
"This instructor has an extremely evident passion for this subject that aids in facilitating meaningful conversation about design. Their excitement is a motivating factor to produce the best work possible. They offer suggestions without forcing them, which presents an opening for creativity from us students.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F23
My only critique is I would have preferred a bit more feedback. At times I felt unsure if my work was going in the right direction and critiques didn't give me as much guidance as I would have liked.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F23
This was my first time having Josh and it was awesome. I loved going to class and getting to work in the room with him. He is full of great ideas and has pushed me to become a better designer. He does his job very well and he cares about his students so much and that is translated in all aspects of the classroom. I am very excited to take another one of his courses next semester.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F23
"Josh, is a very great professor. He is dedicated to his craft. He did a great job of encouraging you to push yourself but also was very supportive. He is also very knowledgeable in the field and that was very helpful throughout the class.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F23
Josh is a great professor and gives great feedback. He genuinely cares about us succeeding.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F23
Professor Cook is well organized and articulated. He also does a great job helping students resolve obstacles that might come along when doing a project.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F23
"The course was clear, and made in a way which promoted the success of each individual student.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F23
"Josh is my favorite teacher in the Visual Communication program, I've had him for a couple classes now. He is super easy to talk to, reasonable, and super helpful and makes each student feel seen and heard!",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F23
"Love Josh, wonderful teacher that asked for student feedback on what they would like to do and learn and always had wonderful feedback and answers when struggling.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F23
I hate adobe after effects and animation/motion design but Josh made me hate it less and motivated me to actually learn more about it outside of class.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F23
"This class is an amazing combination of history and contemporary design. Not only do you learn about design starting as early as the 1300s, but also get to compare it to design in 2023 - such an amazing thing to dive into.",Loyola University Chicago,History of Graphic Design,F23
"I was lucky enough to stumble upon this course, as it is only offered every couple of years and I am so happy that I did.",Loyola University Chicago,History of Graphic Design,F23
Josh is great at providing feedback on assignments - he is thorough and loves to help students when we are feeling stumped. His lectures are also very interesting 100% of the time!,Loyola University Chicago,History of Graphic Design,F23
My only comment is that it was sometimes difficult to follow along on lecture days. Would have appreciated more student engagement.,Loyola University Chicago,History of Graphic Design,F23
My first time having Josh as a professor. Sadly already a senior but definitely the best professor in the fnar program. Wish I could have had him more. He's one of those rare great teachers that truly connects with the students and has great insight in regards to design.,Loyola University Chicago,History of Graphic Design,F23
"The OneDrive folder is a little extra, especially when first starting. It's not fun to have another whole thing to go to.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S24
"This class greatly exceeded my expectations in terms of learning material. Each project was very unique and presented a new set of challenges. My only critique would be that the series workshop felt a a bit repetitive on the third pass through but other than that, I enjoyed the course a lot.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S24
"Sometimes you go over things, especially in demonstrations very quickly. It would be nice if you went more slowly and frequently paused and waited for us to catch up and ask questions.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S24
"I really enjoyed this course. As someone who has never used Adobe before, it was very insightful and I feel like I learned the basic skills for InDesign and Illustrator. I know this course is designed more towards those who do have more experience in Adobe software, so it was a little hard for me to get going, but I was still able to complete all of the projects with work I am happy with. The readings were a little much for a fine arts class. Some of them were interesting but most of them just confused me.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S24
"The lectures go a little fast, but it is helpful when I shares the demos on the OneDrive. He talks a little quietly, so sometimes I couldn't hear what he is saying, but he was always open to meet and help with anything he could. He was very understanding and was always willing to demo something again.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S24
"Josh is a great instructor, loved having him for multiple classes this year. He is very hands-on and I especially appreciated all the demos he would do for us. The critiques were also very helpful in developing my skills and it was nice to hear new ideas both from him and fellow peers about things I could improve on or experiment later on with.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S24
Gave the perfect amount of constructive criticism and praise during critiques. It never felt as though any creative work was being put down which was nice.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,S24
"Stuck to syllabus with minor changes: everything was very attainable, but still very challenging.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
Professor Cook effectively balances the use of digital programs and online resources while also providing ample opportunities to create using physical mediums.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
"I really enjoyed the freedom Josh offered us, and it felt like a strong community by the end of the year.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
"I wish both projects were not revolved around book making, just because we have done some version of that in all the Vis Comm classes I have taken!",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
I would take Josh for every class if I could! It is refreshing to have a professor who allows you to chase after your creative ideas and really think outside of the box. His classrooms are collaborative environments and I think that is why you see such great work from the students come out of it!,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
I wish that we got specific feedback in the form of a rubric for our assignments. It's hard to know where you lost points or how you are being graded without it.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
"Professor Cook is truly one of the best instructors I've ever had. He's funny, engaging, scary knowledgeable, and challenges us in really interesting ways. I truly can't praise him enough.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
"Professor Cook is invested in every student's growth and encourages them to push creative boundaries. I also appreciate how he encourages us to look beyond a corporate, mainstream lens and explore an exciting future for design.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
"Professor Cook is one of the most effective professors I have had in a while. He creates a comfortable classroom environment and encourages dialogue between everyone. In this course, not only do I feel like I am learning from him, but I feel as if I am learning from the whole class in general.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
Very thankful for how available he was outside of class time and I like the amount of desk crits because it was a great way to get specific feedback on the projects.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,S24
This course is not an easy one: Adobe can be a difficult platform to work with but Josh makes sure that everyone is able to succeed on their own level!,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
The course design allocates a sufficient amount of time to understand the assignment and complete it within reason. The demonstration days are vital to utilizing different techniques to go about an assignment. There is room for creativity and innovation with every project.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
This course was definitely the most challenging for me but also the one I feel like I learned the most. Whether that be with my own creative process or with utilizing online resources. I am still not the most confident in using programs such as After Effects but now I feel like I have a good foundation for future work.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
"A lot of outside coursework, but very worth it and you learn a ton!",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
"What I enjoy about this course is that its open for interpretation. We are allowed to take the overarching project and turn it into something that we, personally, find fulfilling and interesting. Which makes the creation process as well as the critique much more personalized and interesting.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
"Josh is a great professor. He encourages everyone to try their big ideas, but critiques you in a way to make you better. This is a really hard course, but he gives you every resource you could possibly need to succeed. Great class!",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
"Josh's enthusiasm for this class and each student's success is reason enough to go to class. He instructs on the topics that are relevant to our projects, educating us on design history while also demonstrating modern techniques.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
"Loved having Josh as an instructor. It was great being in a room with such creative passion, including my other peers, and he has a way of bringing that energy of other people.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
I always enjoy Josh's classes. He has great feedback and provides so much helpful information.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
Josh is a great professor. He gives very positive and constructive feedback throughout each of the projects that we had worked on. He cares about the success of his students and does a great job facilitating discussions with the readings he chooses that relates to our course.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
"I'm a big fan of Josh, he's super hands on with us during our creation process and provides really helpful and productive feedback. It feels like he creates an environment in which we are one big group of designers just bouncing ideas off of each other. It presents itself as a very casual work spaces but then I come out of it having learned alot.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,S24
Every element of homework and projects took place online and the course invited opportunities to explore and combine various creative platforms as well as code our own creative web content.,Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S24
I enjoyed every aspect of this class. D Josh Cook well organized as a professor Lectures and assignments were clear. Schedule nearly accurate.,Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S24
"I learned so much cool stuff in this class this semester. It really opened my eyes into what interactive design was and allowed me to think critically about what I was doing. It was a fun and rewarding class that made me feel like I may want to pursue interactive design more in the future. I especially appreciated our crash course in creative coding, that stuff is so cool.",Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S24
"I love having classes with Josh, he's a great teacher and person overall!",Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S24
Josh rocks. I'm a little lost with the p5 boot camp but going to class is fun for me which is something that I really appreciate.,Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S24
Josh is a great instructor he always gives 1000% even when he has multiple classes at a time. I admire his hard work and kind heart.,Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S24
Josh is a great professor. He gave very positive and constructive feedback throughout each of the projects that we had worked on. He cares about the success of his students and does a great job facilitating discussions with the readings he chooses that relates to our course.,Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S24
"Josh harbors a really cool and creative space to work in but he also makes it so that you'll only get out as much as your put in, which I really appreciated. This class took some real outside of the box thinking and Josh created and harbored an environment where that wasn't only appreciated, but welcomed.",Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S24
Professor D Josh Cook made expectations clear and reasonable. Professor successfully taught me and other classmates complex information.,Loyola University Chicago,Interactive Design,S24
The demos were really disorganized and hard to follow,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F24
"The class website with all of the resources was very helpful at times. The OneDrive is very well organized and easy to navigate, I enjoyed using it rather than Sakai.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F24
"I enjoyed learning the technical side of typography, definitely allowed me to be more thoughtful in my design.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F24
"I loved the way the course was organized into different projects, which were easy to keep track of and touched on different skills and design principles.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F24
"Sometimes he moved way too quickly, especially when most of us were beginners. About 80% of my time working on homework was spent trying to figure out the applications because I felt like the instructions and demos during class were not suited to someone who has no experience in Adobe applications. I think explaining things step-by-step might be a better approach for at least the start of the semester while students get the hang of things might be a better approach. However, when I did need help he was extremely responsive and quick to help me problem solve.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F24
I think Prof. Cook could've spoken up while presenting information. He would be very loud and then quiet down towards the end of his sentences. Other than that it was a great experience,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F24
"Great professor, passionate about the subject",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F24
I like that you added the lecture notes in OneDrive but when presenting information I wish you would go a little bit slower (especially when demoing things),Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F24
"Some of the demos were a little confusing for the design softwares, but he always went back and helped if we had questions to ask.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication I,F24
Well designed course I feel like my skills as a graphic designer has greatly improved. I feel confident in my abilities to understand typefaces and understand how things are made.,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F24
"I really liked this professors project ideas and I thought he was very creative, but he did not actually teach us much in terms of skill. I am a visual person and need to be walked through how to do something but Josh kinda just expected us to know as the projects got harder and more complex.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F24
Overall one of my favorite courses by-far. I really appreciate Josh's dedication to teaching his students how to make tangible products and explore their creative sides. Well spoken professor that knows his way around the field and can provide inspiration from so many different aspects of the internet. He's exceeded my expectations when it came to his knowledge. Hope to forever be his student and keep learning from him!,Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F24
I am so grateful for Josh as an instructor because he really opened my brain to different ways and methods of thinking about design. :),Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F24
"Fantastic professor. Very accommodating. He's easy to talk to. I told him that I was anxious about after collage and how I want to be a professor, he eased my worries giving me solid advice on how to enter the industry and how to become a professor. I enjoyed talking to him.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F24
"The discussions often felt a little awkward, and I think the main reason was because it was such a big space to talk in, lots of peers and this is a psychological phenomena called ""Group Think"" where people try to agree with everyone's statements to remain unanimous. There are solutions to Group Thinking, such as starting in small groups then opening the floor to everyone--just something to consider.",Loyola University Chicago,Visual Communication II,F24
"I think that honestly by the end of it I felt like the course was well constructed. I appreciated your ability to allow flexibility, and ultimately, I really have enjoyed all the projects.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F24
"The course was structured well, however sometimes due dates would sneak up on people and time for specific projects needed to be balanced more. (Ex. more time for more labor intensive/multiple program projects).",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F24
Josh is a wonderful professor. He makes himself available to you inside and outside of class to a selfless degree. He truly cares about teaching you and helping your artistic vision to be completed.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F24
"Demos were hard to follow at first, but Josh accepted feedback and split it up so it was easier to navigate later.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F24
I think it could be helpful to have demo days where students are following the instructions instead of the instructor just showing things in after effects. Maybe there could be mini in class assignments to help get students more comfortable in specific parts of the software,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F24
"Josh is one of the best teachers in the art department. This class uses extremely difficult software (After Effects), yet he is there every step of the way to answer questions and offer great advice and ideas on how to improve our projects and overall vision further.",Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F24
I appreciated how he offered up some of his own time and art supplies for student use. This is my favorite course I have taken so far. He was receptive to feedback and gave useful critiques.,Loyola University Chicago,Motion Design,F24
"Josh is great! He is a great professor and is so knowledgeable, this is the second time I have taken one of his classes and I would again if I had the opportunity!",Loyola University Chicago,Digital Media Design,F24
